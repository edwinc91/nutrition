# nutrition

I created this app with the thought of having users sign up and using the site to log their daily calorie intakes. After a meal, they can simply log in and post what they ate and how many calories it was(approximately).

As something extra, I want to see if it is possible to incorporate a calorie/food api that can autofill the calories a certain food type is, such as a big mac meal, or a grilled chicken salad. Obviously, the calories won't be exact, as the calories would vary depending on factors such as dressing for a salad, or the way it is cooked, however I feel like it would be cool to have something that could approximate the calories something is. That way, it can give users an idea of what to put down.

Another cool feature I would like to incorporate is a place/forum where users can share their data and get feedback from/give inspiration to other users.

I had a difficult time getting all of the jQuery to work properly, as I was a little rusty on it, after not really having to use it for so long. One of the problems I ran into was getting input boxes to correctly correspond with the data values so it would get stored properly into the database when a user added new input boxes for additional meals.

I created this app through Express/Node, using MongoDb as a database that stores a user's information. I used Bootstrap as a base when it came to styling my app, and then fiddled with it using pure css. A site that helped me out a lot when it came to getting my app to look the way I wanted it to was https://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-a-notebook-design-with-css/. Additionally, I got the emoticons from http://unicodeemoticons.com/.
